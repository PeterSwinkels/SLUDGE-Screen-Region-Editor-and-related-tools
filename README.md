# SLUDGE-Screen-Region-Editor-and-related-tools

This project includes several programs designed to assist in scripting with a game creation tool called SLUDGE by Hungry Software. The website can be found at http://opensludge.github.io/

The Screen Region Editor is a tool that allows the user to draw so called screen regions using the mouse rather than having to manually type in the code. The other tools assist in generating code for scaling and viewing objects defined in a script. Also included is a TARGA TrueVision image loader which can easily be reused in other Microsoft Visual Basic 6.0 projects.
